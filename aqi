## Challenge & Context

During 2020-2021 at Karrierestart, we noticed a substantial drop-off rate after sign-up. Many users weren't fully leveraging the full potential of the portal, leading us to a mission: revamp for better engagement.

The project was particularly complex due to the platform's multi-sided nature, catering to both job-seekers, companies, and freelancers. At the same time covid put a strain on our resources. Our focus? Enhance UX without imposing heavy changes on our developers.

Tesco were struggling to maintain and build upon their exisitng cross playform app. We designed and built two native apps, focusing on usability, scaleability and accessibility.

## Research sometimes lead to pivots

### Doing Research in Covid Lockdown

The objective was clear: enhance profile content on KS by increaing engagement. At the same time, there were challenges, like layoffs and the pandemic restrictions. The question we grappled with was, "How do we get user insights under these conditions?"

### Proactive Measures:

To get insight into user behavior, I took initiative to integrate Hotjar on the portal. Its recordings and heatmaps vividly depicted areas where the user journey stuttered. Furthermore, I set up a feedback module, so we could zoom in on specific user pain points.

### Remote Insights:

Traditional face-to-face interviews were off the table. Instead, I dispatched surveys for insights and turned to remote platforms like Teston.io and Usertesting.com. The remote validation of our designs turned out to be highly effective.

### Fostering User Engagement:

With an eye on further amplifying user engagement, I studied Nir Eyal's Hook model. Then I explored ways to incorporate this framework into our platform.
